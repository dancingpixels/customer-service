### Customer Service: Handling Abusive customers

#### Steps for handling abusive customers

1. Assess the customer service interaction

   - Why is the customer upset?
   - What does the customer want at the end of the transaction?
   - What can you do to solve their problem?
     - Avoid using the word `No` to keep the transaction moving in a positive direction

2. Reassure the customer

3. Use empathy to show you care

   - To the abusive customer, lack of empathy is fuel for fire.

4. Change the customer focus

5. Resolve the customer issue

   - understand the problem

   - confirm what they want
   - Try to do what they want.

6. Abort the interaction

   When do you abort a transaction? <u>After you have given great customer service and the customer is still extremely upset.</u> 

   How to abort an interaction

   1. Remind the customer:

      - You care
      - They are important to you and your company
      - You want them to leave happy

   2. Apologize for not being able to serve them at this time.

      `We cannot serve you while you are abusive towards us, you may come back when you can have a calm conversation and be respective of me and my collegues.` 

   3. Be careful with the language that you use.

   4. Take further action if the customer refuses to leave or keeps calling back.

      - Notify your manager if you have one.
      - If you are in physical danger, notify security or run away immediately.

   **Code System to Rate Trouble Customers**

   - Stage 1: `Code Orange`
     - Customer using explicit language, yelling, and has disdain towards you.
   - Stage 2: `Code Yellow`
     - Customer using explicit language, yelling, and degrading or being abusive towards you.
   - Stage 3: `Code Red`
     - Customer using explicit language, yelling, and degrading and threating you mentally and physically.

   You do not have to tolerate abusive customers.

7. Follow up with the customer

   You can use `follow up` to turn an abusive customer into a loyal customer. How does this happen? - Emotion. Emotion is energy.

   Follow up a customer with negative energy after things have calmed down and turn all their negative energy into positive energy making them a happy customer in the process.

   <u>Steps to Following Up</u>

   - Remind Customer that your goal is to serve them
   - Gauge the state of mind of the customer
     - Are they still irate?
     - Are they calm?
     - Are they apologetic?
   - Offer the customer an unexpected item of value
     - Coupon
     - Discount
     - Free Gift
     - Free Shipping
     - Full refund ?
       - <u>The Law of reciprocity</u> - offering an unexpected item of value becomes a <u>peace offering.</u>  When you offer someone a gift, *oftentimes* they will feel they owe you a gift in return.

#### Steps to implement

1. Create a list of common situations you encounter
2. Come up with many solutions and practice
3. Implement this code system into your employee handbook



### Creating Positive Conversations with Challenging Customers

Telling a customer what you can do.

#### Working with difficult customers

1. Be positive with customers not provoking

   - Work to keep interactions positive by offering explanation or options

     ```markdown
     There's nothing we can do! 
     ---
     One Thing we can try is...
     ---
     ```

   - Look to give a positive slant when giving bad news.

2. Pacing your customers

   - Pace with urgency
   - Pace with agreement
     - `I can see your point on that.`
     - `I know that had to be frustrating`.
   - If you outpaced, walk it back 

3. Ask `what else?` questions.

   - Use "what else" to manage expectations.
   - Use "what else" to recap and and give next steps.

#### Positive Positioning Skills

1. Use partnership language with customers.

2. Overcome resistance with customers.

   - Sense the situation from their perspective
   - Discuss the things upsetting the customer
   - Offer solutions to fix the issue

4. Words and Phrases to avoid - and better options

   - When correcting a confused customer 
     - Don't be short, and don't make them feel foolish
     - Avoid words that elicit negative feelings:
       - When dealing with a failed transaction
         - `I'm having trouble authorizing your card.`
       - Explaining a fault
         - `Let's take a look and see what's going on.`

5. How to apologize 

   An apology isn't about placing blame.

   How to apologize when the situation isn't your company's fault.

   - `We are sorry for any frustration you may have experienced`.
   - `We are sorry you had to make this call today.`

   Notice that none of the preceding apologies admit fault - apologies can be safe. Apologize without opening up the chance of liability claims.

   <u>Steps to a good apology</u>

   1. State only the facts - never share your opinion as to what caused the problem.
   2. Don't assume fault for the mishap and don't blame others.
   3. Apologize for the impact on the customer and not for the issue itself.

#### Positive Positioning in action

- Positioning your return or refund policies.

  2 step process for returns and exchanges

  - Acknowledge the impact.
  - Explain how the policy benefits the customer.

- Issues with billing or customer rewards

  <u>With billing issues it's not the mistake that gets you in trouble. It's how you handle the issue.</u>

  3 ways to handle billing complaints better:

  - Thank the customer.
    - `Thanks for giving us a chance to fix this.`
  - Don't challenge the customer.
    - Your focus is not to prove the customer wrong.
  - Apologize regardless of fault.

- "Your competition is better"

  Customers sometimes make unfair comparisons to your competition. Help customers see when their competition is  an `apples to oranges` comparison.

  For pricing comparisons

  - Point out the benefits you offer - your Unique Selling Point.
  - Justify a perceived lack of a quality as a benefit.
  - Don't make negative remarks about your competitors.

### De-Escalating Intense Situations

*Successfully defuse intense situations with angry customers. Learn practical approaches for managing a customer's frustration, as well as  your own.*

#### Preempt an Escalation

1. Three reasons situations escalate - and how to solve the problem.
   - Customers don't accept your word as final.
     - Position yourself as the expert, talk assertively and offer options when you can.
   - They think it's faster to go to the top.
     - Say, "I can connect you to a supervisor but I may be able to help. Will you give me a chance to assist you first?"
   - A `cycle of escalation` is put into motion.
     - A cycle of escalation is put into motion when you don't put forth the effort to dig deep for the customer.

2.  Positive Positioning

   Delivering a message in a positive way to minimize a negative reaction.

   <u>Using positive positioning</u>

   - Maximize positive language and minimize negative words

     - Avoid words like `problem` use `the situation` instead.
     - Don't use `unfortunately`.
     - Use `aboslutely...definitely...certainly`.

   - Reframe the problem.

     > "while the warranty doesn't cover this, we do have a couple of options for you today."

   - Reflect your brand promise.

3. The `Don't push` principle.

   > Instead of saying "there's nothing we can do.",  say "we will look into this."

4. Manage customer expectations

   > I'm noting that your flight was canceled because of bad weather. Our policy states *reservation not canceled 72 hours prior to check-in will be charged a cancellation fee.*  But I have opened a case documenting weather as the reason you canceled. The local hotel will research and back to you. Please understand, this is solely at the manager's discretion.

   Paint a clear picture of what may happen

   - Don't over-promise
   - Try to proactively give customers what they need.

5. Be regretful but direct with customers

   Say what you mean, mean what you say , but don't be mean when you say it.

   - Be firm, confident and final.

#### Three-step deescalation

1. Recognize the customer's emotions

   > "I know you are eager to see this resolved."

2. Reframe the conversation

   Reframing helps you take control, deflect intense emotion, and keep the interactions focused.

   - "Here's what we know."
     - Give them details
     - Be confident and transparent

   - "Here's what we've done."
     - List steps taken to fix the issue

   - "Here's what we've done."
     - Let them know when they will be contacted.

   > "The accident happened in our garage at 7:42 PM. The driver was in white Honda Civic and he left the scene. We have filled a claim with our laws prevention team and we filed a police report. You also need to submit a police report and you also need to notify both your insurance company and your rental car company."

3. Resolve the customer Issue.

   A key to deescalation is  moving the conversation forward to closure.

   > "We appreciate hearing about your experience, but we cannot compensate you because the damage is due to normal wear and tear."

#### Double your effectiveness deescalating

1. Listen with the intent to understand.

   - Don't interrupt or make assumptions.

2. Use partnering language to understand

3. Dealing with your own frustration

   - Quit Taking it Personally. `Qtip`
   - Put yourself in the customer's shoes
   - Wait 1-2 seconds before saying anything.
   - Don't say anything you wouldn't say to your grandmother.

4. Dealing with demanding customers

   - Keep your responses brief.

   - Use Silence - don't interrupt enraged customers

   - Draw the line.

     > "I'm sorry it's not possible for me to help while listening to that language, if it stops, I can help."
     >
     > "I'm trying to help you, but if you continue to yell or swear, I'm going to ask that you call back another time."
